This week took a lot of trial and error for me. Also I am sorry I am slightly late my computer crashed on me two days ago so I had to start my project over again and I have been camped out in the library for a little trying to make a fuctionable code. I understood making the balls bounce off the walls as you give atom the boundries for the ball, and than once it gets outside of those boundraies you will have a change of direction. The hard part for me was being able to create a function for letting the balls bounce off of one another. At first I didn't realize that I need to put "balls, i" in the spot where I define the ballCheck function. I thought that would fix my problem, but it still didn't after searching through my code for a long time I realized that I was simply just missing my n inside the other balls function and it worked. I wanted to create something festive with thanksgiving coming up, so I made a green red and orange function after that where the balls color would change to red if it was hit by another ball. I understood changing the index so I could let me two sketch.js and balls.js files work together well. Hopefully I get my computer back soon so I won't have to be hogging the multimedia computurs at the library though.
